# finetuning-LAION-LeoLM-for-rewriting-scientifically

## Fine-tuning the LeoLM language model to improve the academic and objective writing style of german text passages.

## Explanation:
This project is part of my software development project in the 4th semester at HTW Berlin. My task was to fine-tune Meta's Large Language Model, LLaMA 2, to rewrite german text passages in a more academic or objective manner.

Since LLaMA 2 has not been sufficiently trained in German and performs poorly in the language, I decided to use LeoLM by LAION (https://huggingface.co/LeoLM/leo-hessianai-7b-chat) as the base model, as this model has already been fine-tuned for the German language.

My responsibilities in this project included the creation of the dataset, the fine-tuning process, and the testing of the models.
